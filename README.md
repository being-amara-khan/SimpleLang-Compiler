## SimpleLang Compiler

```markdown


Welcome to the SimpleLang Compiler project! This is a basic compiler built using Python and Tkinter that performs various phases of compilation on code written in a simple programming language. The compiler includes functionality for lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. Additionally, it can run the compiled code and handle file operations.

# Features

- Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the input code and displays the tokens.
- Syntax Analysis: Placeholder for syntax tree generation (currently a placeholder).
- Semantic Analysis: Placeholder for semantic analysis (currently a placeholder).
- Code Generation: Placeholder for generating code from the input (currently a placeholder).
- Run Code: Executes the input code and displays the output.
- Open File: Allows you to open a text file containing code to be analyzed.
- Exit: Closes the application.

# Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simplelang-compiler.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd simplelang-compiler
   ```

4. Install any required dependencies. For this project, Tkinter is used, which is included with Python. No additional packages are required.

# Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python simplelang_compiler.py
   ```

2. The application window will appear. You can perform the following actions:

   - **Lexical Analysis**: Click "Lexical Analysis" to see the tokens generated from the input code.
   - **Syntax Analysis**: Click "Syntax Analysis" to view the syntax tree output (currently a placeholder).
   - **Semantic Analysis**: Click "Semantic Analysis" to view the semantic analysis output (currently a placeholder).
   - **Generate Code**: Click "Generate Code" to see the generated code output (currently a placeholder).
   - **Run Code**: Click "Run Code" to execute the input code and display the output.
   - **Open File**: Click "Open File" to load code from a text file into the editor.
   - **Exit**: Click "Exit" to close the application.
